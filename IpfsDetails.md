# Ipfs

-   Ipfs, hash the code/file and get a unique hash that only points to that data
-   We can pin that hash to Ipfs node
-   one Ipfs node is connected to a network of other Ipfs nodes
-   If we request our hash to any Ipfs node it will go the node that has it and deliver back to us
-   Another cool thing is after returning the hash to us, the node which dosen't have our hash will also pin our hash
-   That node will get a copy of that hash
-   By this way, all nodes can talk to each other and,
-   If hash is present in one node, other node can pin it to itself
-   By this way, decentralized bahviour is implemented.
-   Ipfs cannot execute smart contracts.
-   It can only store files
-   Ipfs is a decentralized storage
